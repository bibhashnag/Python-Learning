# Python Code Structure

Code structuring is required to maintaine code:
  - Readability
  - Modularity
  - Documentation and code
  - Consistent naming convention
  - Error handling
  - Testing

### Basic Rules

Here are some basic rules to write python code:
1. Source code is basically a set of statements
2. No end-of-statement character needed in python
3. No need to use special function as entry point
4. Execution happens from starting line to the next unless there is conditional statement
5. Add whitespaces between keywords
6. Add new line between statements
7. You can create comments
    - Full line comment
    - End of line comment
    - Multiline comment
  
### Lexical Structure
- Lexicon: Its a collection of reserver words, keywords, literals etc.
- They are converted to tokens
- Tokens are atomic code elements
- With tokens the parser creates an abstract syntax tree

### Lexicons(Vocabulary)
Lexicons are basically the following:
- Reserve words
- Identifier
- Comments
- Literals
- Operators
- Delemiters

### Syntax Rule
Follow the below syntax rules in python for:
- Indentation
- Colons
- Whitespace
- Quotation Mark
- Paranthesis
- End of Statement

### Semantics
Semantics in pythons are:
- Variable assignment
- Function Calls
- Control Flow
- Exception Handling
- Input/Output
- Modularization
